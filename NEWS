             2017-07-01 Version 2.1.0 released.
             Version 2 incorporates wavelet local multiple correlations (WLMC).
             These are like the previous global WMC but consisting in one
             single set of multiscale correlations along time. That is, at each time
             t, they are calculated by letting a window of weighted wavelet
             coefficients around t move along time. Six weight functions are provided.
             Namely, the  uniform window, Cleveland's tricube window, Epanechnikov's
             parabolic window, Bartlett's triangular window and Wendland's truncated
             power window and the Gaussian window.
